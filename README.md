## DESCRIPTION

Anonip is a tool to anonymize IP-addresses in log-files of Apache Webserver

It masks the last bits of IPv4- and IPv6-addresses. That way most of the
relevant information is preserved, while the IP-address does not match a
particular individuum anymore.

The log-entries get directly piped from Apache to Anonip. The unmasked IP-
addresses are never written to any file.

With the help of cat, it's also possible, to rewrite existing log-files.

**A Note for Nginx logs:** This fork is a take on https://github.com/DigitaleGesellschaft/Anonip/issues/1

As there is no way to configure the actual error log format in Nginx, this
version has an additional option '--nginx' that will make anonip.py to look for
a 'client:' string in a log line. If it finds one, it will anonymize it, if not,
it will anonymize the column configured, that way it is possible to pass access.log
and error.log with the same options through anonip.py in a logrotate configuration. 

## FUNCTIONS

 - Masks IP-addresses in log-files
 - Configurable amount of masked bits
 - The column containing the IP-address can freely be chosen
 - Works for both access.log- and error.log-files

## OPTIONS
```
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug         debug
  --ipv4mask N        truncate the last N bits (default: 12)
  --ipv6mask N        truncate the last N bits (default: 84)
  --increment N       increment the IP address by N (default: 0)
  --output FILE       write to file (default: None)
  --column N [N ...]  assume IP address is in column n (default: 1)
  --replace STRING    replacement string in case address parsing fails
                      (default: None. Example: 0.0.0.0)
  --user USERNAME     switch user id
  --group GROUPNAME   switch group id
  --umask UMASK       set umask
  --nginx             additionally try to find ip behind "client:" for
                      nginx error-log
```

## USAGE
In the Apache configuration (or the one of the vhost) the log-output needs to
get piped to anonip:
```
CustomLog "|/path/to/anonip.py [OPTIONS] --output /path/to/log" combined
```
That's it! All the IP-addresses will be masked in the log now.

Alternative:
```
cat /path/to/orig_log | /path/to/anonip.py [OPTIONS] --output /path/to/log
```
## MOTIVATION

In a time, where the mass-data-collection of certain companies and
organisations gets more and more obvious, it's crutial to realize, that also
we maintain unnecessary huge data-collections.

For example admins of webservers. In the log-files you can find all the IP-
addresses of all visitors in cleartext and all of a sudden we possess a huge
collection of personalized data.

Anonip tries to avoid exactly that, but without losing the undisputed benefit
of those log-files.

With the masking of the last bits of IP-addresses, we're still able to
distinguish them up to a certain degree. Compared to the entire removal of the
IP-adresses, we're still able to make a rough geolocating as well as a reverse
DNS lookup. But the otherwise distinct IP-addresses do not match a particular
individuum anymore.
